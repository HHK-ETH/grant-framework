### Project Overview and Ecosystem Fit
Sushi is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), we aim to be a one-stop shop for all your
decentralized finance (DeFi) needs. Sushi allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without the
need for a central operator administrator, using their own preferred connected crypto wallet.
Users can buy and sell across 11,700 cryptocurrency pairs and trade tokens across ten
crypto networks (and counting) via the newly launched cross-chain swap (SushiXSwap).
Next to trading you can: earn, stack yields, stream, vest on one decentralized, community
driven platform.

Sushi’s products are open-source and configured in a way that allows the entire platform to
maintain decentralized governance of $SUSHI token holders, while continuing to innovate on
the collective foundations by design. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the
community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy
and overall development implementation is done by a core team.

Thus far, the core products, include:
● a decentralized exchange (Swap)
● a decentralized multichain exchange (SushiXSwap)
● yield instruments (Onsen)
● a base vault (BentoBox)
● an AMM framework (Trident)
● a payroll solutions for vesting and streaming (Furo)
